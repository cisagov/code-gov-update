This project contains code for updating the DHS
[code.gov](https://code.gov) inventory published
[here](https://www.dhs.gov/code.json).

## How it works ##

The [LLNL/scraper](https://github.com/LLNL/scraper) project is used to
scrape a handful of GitHub organizations that belong to DHS and
produce an updated JSON file per [the code.gov
specification](https://code.gov/about/compliance/inventory-code).  If
that file differs from the previously-generated one, it is emailed to
the appropriate address so that it can be used to update the content
hosted [here](https://www.dhs.gov/code.json).
