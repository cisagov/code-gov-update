# We need a bugfix for behavior in newer versions of cloc. Since there is not a
# release on PyPI with the code in https://github.com/LLNL/scraper/pull/79, we
# must instead pull directly from the GitHub repository. We use the latest (as
# of this comment) commit on the default branch to serve as our version pin
